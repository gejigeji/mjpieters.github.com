Zopatista's personal site
-------------------------

My personal site, stripped down to something I'll actually maintain.

The projects folder only exists to support legacy URLs; the contents redirect
to pypi mostly, except for the python distribution files, for which proper
redirects would otherwise be too cumbersome to support.
